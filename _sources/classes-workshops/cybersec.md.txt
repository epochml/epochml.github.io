September 10, 18:00~18:45 in Math Study Area (lecture)  
19:15~19:45 in Science Study Area (attacking the example vulnerable website)

We explained the importance of cybersecurity work, and explained several common vulnerabilities on websites:
* SQL injection
* IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
* Cookie manipulation
* Cross-site scripting

We also hosted a vulnerable website that was designed to demonstrate these different attacks.
