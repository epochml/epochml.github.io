# Machine learning

* Basics of machine learning
  * We will be using the PyTorch library with online notebooks
  * Neural networks
  * Gradient descent
  * Other topics depending on interest
* Basic Python knowledge is helpful
  * Needed to follow along, but you can understand the lectures without
